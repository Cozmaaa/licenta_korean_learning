  "       Hangeul, also known as the Korean alphabet, is the writing system used in South and North Korea. It was invented in the 15th century during the Joseon Dynasty by King Sejong the Great and a group of scholars. Before the creation of Hangeul, Koreans used Hanja, which are Chinese characters adapted for Korean. However, Hanja was difficult for common people to learn and use. King Sejong wanted to create a writing system that was easy to learn and accessible to everyone, regardless of their social class or education. Hangeul consists of 24 letters: 14 consonants and 10 vowels. The letters are combined to form syllabic blocks, each typically representing a syllable. The shapes of the consonants are designed to resemble the position and shape of the mouth and tongue when making the corresponding sounds. One of the unique features of Hangeul is that it is a featural writing system, meaning that the shapes of the letters are related to the phonetic features of the sounds they represent. This makes it easier to learn and remember the letters and their sounds. Hangeul is considered one of the most scientific and efficient writing systems in the world. It is easy to learn, with most people being able to master the basics within a few hours. The simplicity and logical structure of Hangeul have contributed to Korea's high literacy rate.";
